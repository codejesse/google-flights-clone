Welcome to the **Google Flights Clone**! This is a React.js-based flight search app using Material UI v6.1.1 and the RapidAPI Sky Scraper API to search and display flight results. The project showcases a user-friendly flight search interface and results display with **Accordion-style flight details**, similar to Google Flights.

## 🚀 Features

- **Flight Search Interface**: Users can search for flights by origin, destination, trip type, flight type, and number of passengers.
- **Flight Results Accordion**: Results are displayed using an accordion UI component that shows the flight date and price, with detailed flight information available in the dropdown.
- **Optimized API Calls**: Memoization and efficient rendering strategies ensure minimal API requests and fast performance.
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Built with Material UI's latest version to ensure the app looks great on all devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material UI v6.1.1**: A popular React UI framework with customizable components.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API calls.
- **RapidAPI Sky Scraper API**: The flight search engine that powers the flight data in this app.

## 📝 How to Install

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-flights-clone.git
   cd google-flights-clone
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create an `.env` file in the root directory with your RapidAPI credentials:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
   ```

4. Run the app locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Flight Search**: The user inputs the necessary flight details (origin, destination, dates, etc.) via Material UI's `Autocomplete` and `TextField` components.
2. **API Integration**: Upon submitting the search, `Axios` fetches flight data from the RapidAPI Sky Scraper API.
3. **Results Display**: The results are shown using Material UI's `Accordion`, where basic flight details (date, price) are shown first. Users can expand to view additional information like departure and arrival times, airline, and flight duration.
4. **Error Handling**: If there's an issue with the API call or data, a `Snackbar` displays an error message, preventing the app from crashing.

## ✨ Demo

🚧 **Live demo coming soon!** Stay tuned for a hosted version on Vercel.
